## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This was similar to the [Product Preview Card Component Challenge](https://github.com/piyasamyak/Front-End-Projects/tree/main/Frontend%20Mentors/Product%20Preview%20Card%20Component) that I completed. I reinforced my understanding of Semantic HTML and CSS custom properties (especially flexbox) while completing this project.

### Continued development

I am going to focus on getting better at image manipulation with CSS as well as organizing content with CSS Flexbox.
